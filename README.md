## üåü Overview  
This project models a subscription-based meal kit service that specializes in **authentic Asian cuisine**. While most existing services cater to Western meals, this service fills a gap in the market by delivering high-quality, restaurant-style Asian dishes directly to customers' homes.

## ü•¢ Key Features  
- **Authentic Recipes:** Pre-portioned ingredients and step-by-step recipes for diverse Asian dishes.  
- **Dietary Options:** Kits support vegan, gluten-free, and allergy-friendly diets.  
- **Convenient & Sustainable:** Reduces food waste and eliminates the hassle of grocery shopping and meal planning.  
- **Influencer Marketing:** Leverages influencers to promote kits through social media.  
- **Supplier Coordination:** Partners with trusted suppliers to source high-quality and rare ingredients.

## üìä SQL and NoSQL Queries

### SQL
```sql
SELECT ProductID, Name, Price FROM PRODUCT WHERE Price > 10.00;

SELECT COUNT(OrderID) AS TotalOrders, AVG(TotalAmount) AS AverageOrderAmount
FROM `ORDER`;

-- High-spending customers
SELECT c.Name, SUM(o.TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent
FROM CUSTOMER c JOIN `ORDER` o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID
HAVING SUM(o.TotalAmount) > (SELECT AVG(TotalAmount) FROM `ORDER`);

-- Union of Customers and Influencers
SELECT Name AS PersonName, 'Customer' AS Role FROM CUSTOMER
UNION
SELECT Name AS PersonName, 'Influencer' AS Role FROM INFLUENCER;
 ```
### NoSQL MongoDB
```sql
// Customers with gluten allergy
db.customers.find({ allergies: "gluten" })

// Count of customers by subscription
db.customers.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$subscriptionPlan", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])

// Total sales per customer (delivered orders)
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customerID", totalSales: { $sum: "$totalAmount" } } }
])
```
## ‚úÖ Conclusion

### üìå Project Outcomes
- Successfully designed and implemented a relational database in **MySQL** and a NoSQL structure in **MongoDB**
- Effectively migrated structured SQL data into MongoDB collections, while maintaining relationship integrity using `ObjectID` fields and references
- Connected the MySQL database to **Python** and executed queries to showcase dynamic data insights
- Queried complex relationships across tables/collections using **SQL joins** and **MongoDB `$lookup`**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Shortcomings
- **MongoDB** does not enforce foreign key constraints, which can lead to **orphaned data** if referenced documents are deleted
- In **SQL**, performance issues may arise with **large joins** and **aggregate queries** over time
- Future improvements include integrating **visualization tools** like **Tableau** or **Power BI** to better present project insights
